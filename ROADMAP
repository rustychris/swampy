Pass existing tests without caveat - DONE as of 2020-04-18
Subgrid for edges & cells - BASIC DONE

Verify that bump tests fail with lack of advection
 - update bump test to deal with subgrid specification
   - currently a disconnect where boundary edges have no area, and
     so we can't calculate Q there.

Add basic upwind momentum advection (roughly what is in Zhao's(sp?) thesis?)

Add 2D test case (parabolic dish)

Refactor

Scalar transport

Improved advection scheme?

Adaptive timestepping

Refactor

Optimize
