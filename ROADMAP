Pass existing tests without caveat - DONE as of 2020-04-18
Subgrid for edges & cells - BASIC DONE

Verify that bump tests fail with lack of advection DONE
 
Add basic upwind momentum advection (similar to Yun Zhang's dissertation,
  but upwind instead of centered)
  - DONE

  What happens with hydraulic jumps?
  
Add 2D test case (parabolic dish)
 - Added, but does not do well.
   Wetting front appears to lag significantly.
   -> Adjust history output locations to match scaled version of Zhang
   -> Plot urad to see if there are obvious issues there (not likely).
   -> Run with/without advection, to understand if that makes a difference
   -> Plot eta as discrete steps for easier visual debugging
   -> Consider ways to adjust edge depths deeper, but maintain stability.
      with the iterative scheme, maybe this becomes a nonissue?

Change testing to py.test, as nose is apparently unmaintained

Check for easy speedups

Scalar transport

Improved advection scheme?

Adaptive timestepping
