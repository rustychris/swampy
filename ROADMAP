Pass existing tests without caveat - DONE as of 2020-04-18
Subgrid for edges & cells - BASIC DONE

Verify that bump tests fail with lack of advection DONE
 
Add basic upwind momentum advection (similar to Yun Zhang's dissertation,
  but upwind instead of centered)
  - DONE

  What happens with hydraulic jumps?
  
Add 2D test case (parabolic dish)
 - Added, but does not do well.
   Wetting front appears to lag significantly.
   -> Adjust history output locations to match scaled version of Zhang
   -> Run with/without advection, to understand if that makes a difference
   -> Plot urad to see if there are obvious issues there (not likely).

Change testing to py.test, as nose is apparently unmaintained

Check for easy speedups

Refactor

Scalar transport

Improved advection scheme?

Adaptive timestepping

Refactor

Optimize
