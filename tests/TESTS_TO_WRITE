More precise test for advection: add an option to scale the advective contribution
or omit entirely, and make sure that the bernoulli tests then fail.

Friction test: open channel flow at normal depth. Are slope and depth about right?

Input test: check that bad subcell areas will raise an error.

Input test: check that out of order subedges and subcells do not affect results.

Input test: check that variable subedge length and subcell area are okay.
